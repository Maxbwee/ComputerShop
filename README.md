# ComputerShop
This is an assignment for the Noroff Academy front-end course. The assignment was to make a front-end based computer store.

The computer shop allows the user to work and earn money to buy laptops. The user may also take a loan from the bank.
After taking out a loan the user must pay the loan back. The user may not take out another loan if one loan is currently active.

The project is made by using vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
